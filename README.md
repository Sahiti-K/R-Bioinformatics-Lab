# 🧬 R Bioinformatics Lab

Welcome to the **R Bioinformatics Lab** — a structured and evolving portfolio documenting my journey to master bioinformatics using **R**. This lab is focused on practical, project-based learning using core R libraries such as `tidyverse`, `Bioconductor`, and `ggplot2`.

> 📌 _Goal: Build real-world skills in bioinformatics using R programming._
