# ðŸš€ 00_Basics

This module covers the essential building blocks of R programming tailored for bioinformatics. It includes:

- Basic R syntax and variables  
- Vectors, data types, and operations  
- Data frames and basic manipulations  
- Introduction to plotting with `ggplot2`

A single example plot is included (`life_expectancy_vs_gdp.png`) to demonstrate basic visualization. 
Since this module contains only one plot, a separate `outputs/` folder is not used â€” the image is stored directly in this directory.

> This folder marks the start of my R journey in bioinformatics. I'm learning from the ground up and documenting everything as I go.
