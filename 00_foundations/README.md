This module covers the essential building blocks of R programming tailored for bioinformatics. It includes:

- Basic R syntax and variables  
- Vectors, data types, and operations  
- Data frames and basic manipulations  
- Introduction to plotting with `ggplot2`

All visual outputs are stored in the `outputs/` folder.

> This folder marks the start of my R journey in bioinformatics. I'm learning from the ground up and documenting everything as I go.
